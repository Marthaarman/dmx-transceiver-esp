# ESP DMX512 - simple DMX Library for (multicore) esp
This library is still in development.
Goal of this library is to offer a simple dmx transceiver to receive and transmit dmx 

Testing is currently ongoing and I'd advice not to use this library until the development / testing stage is over.
Currently the library is in a very early stage and nowhere near complete.

Tips and hints welcome in the issues.
